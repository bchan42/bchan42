## Hi, I'm Bernette 👋

I'm a recent graduate from Cal Poly SLO with a background in **Data Science** and **Applied Mathematics**. I’m passionate about uncovering insights through data, building machine learning models, and applying quantitative methods to real-world problems.

I'm currently looking for roles in **data science**, **analytics**, or **quantitative research**.

Recent projects include:
- **Wildfire Policy Extraction and Mapping** – NLP + GIS to extract and visualize municipal fire policies
- **Agent-Based Cardiac Model** – Simulated cardiac action potentials to analyze arrhythmia behavior
- **Spam Email Classifier (Java)** – Built a neural network from scratch to classify spam messages
- **Photo Classifier (CNN)** – Trained a convolutional neural network to classify images by photographer based on visual style
- **Location-Based Social App** – Web app for LGBTQ+ community (2nd Place, Most Innovative at oSTEM Hackathon)
